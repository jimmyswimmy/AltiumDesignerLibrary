You've got big designs, you've got lots of components, and you've got multiple developers scrambling and scraping for the same sets of parts, with no way to keep a handle on what components people are using or how components are being created, modified, and stored over time.  You may even have read the Altium documentation, only to be frustrated by the fact that Altium seems to do _everything for everyone_ but provides little guidance on which features are right _for you._\r\n\r\n### The Elevator Pitch\r\nAltium Designer Library (ADL) is an [imaginatively named](http://www.michaelfogleman.com/) web-based tool that simplifies the task of using [Subversion Database Libraries](http://wiki.altium.com/display/ADOH/Working+with+Version-Controlled+Database+Libraries) with Altium Designer.  Version-controlled database libraries provide the most flexibility and power _by far_ of all the library management options offered by Altium, and ADL provides an interface that makes that flexibility and power easy and fun to use.\r\n\r\n### How it Works\r\nADL provides clean and simple web access to both the database and the subversion components of a [version-controlled database library](http://wiki.altium.com/display/ADOH/Working+with+Version-Controlled+Database+Libraries).  Components can be created, modified or removed, and convenient access to the list of subversion-managed symbols and footprints is provided to make synchronization between the database records and the subversion parts as easy as possible.  Searching, filtering and sorting of components is supported, and convenient features such as auto-complete are provided wherever it makes sense.  With ADL, database and libraries are organized in such a way that databases created in separate environments can be merged with little difficulty.\r\n\r\n### Eye Candy\r\n[SCREENSHOTS GO HERE]"}
